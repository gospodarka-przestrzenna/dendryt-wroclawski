Description
-----------

This is QGIS plugin 
The Application provides two components:

 - the multivariate analysis tool that uses Sammon Mapping technique to transform multivariable data into visualisable state (2D/3D)
 - the tool that makes clusterisation based on modified Spanning Tree approach by loosely implement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bor%C5%AFvka%27s_algorithm with changes by Wawrzyniec Zipser

Distinct features and vocabulary
--------------------------------
 - **Sammon Mapping** - the technique that allows to transform multivariate data into 2D/3D space
 - **Spanning Tree** - the algorithm that allows to clusterize data based on the distance between points
 - **Borůvka's algorithm** - the algorithm that allows to clusterize data based on the distance between points
 - **Non distinct weight edges** - the algorithm allows to clusterize data based on the distance between points
